In a heliocentric coordinate system, let the star have position, λ**s**, where **s** is a unit vector.

Project λ**s** onto the ecliptic at **q**.

Let **u** be the position of the Earth when it is in the direction of **q** and
let **v** be the position of the Earth 90° is further round the sun, i.e. when **u**.**v** is zero.

Then, assuming a circular orbit, the Earth position is **e** = **u**cosθ + **v**sinθ

For the purposes of parallax, we need to project **e** onto the plane perpendicular to **s**, which means subtracting the **s**-component.

The projected Earth, **h** = **e** - (**e**.**s**)**s**

Expanding:

**h** = **u**cosθ + **v**sinθ - ((**u**cosθ + **v**sinθ).**s**)**s**

Collecting terms and noting **v**.**s** is zero:

**h** = (**u** - (**u**.**s**)**s**)cosθ + **v**sinθ

Let **u** - (**u**.**s**)**s** be **w**, so that **h** = **w**cosθ + **v**sinθ

**w** is perpendicular to **v** and is also shorter than **v**.

So from the point of view of the star, the Earth moves in an ellipse with major-axis **v**.
